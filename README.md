# Mekanica for Minecraft 1.12 #

Mekanica started as a short-lived fork of Mekanism that focused on addressing bugs and performance issues. Mekanism has since
started being actively maintained by a team of people and the improvements from Mekanica have been incorporated into the mainline
after the Mekanism 9.7.0 release.
